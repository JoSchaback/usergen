# usergen
Small program to generate usernames, such as *AmbitiousParrot2012*, *JoyfulEnterprise6338*, *HopefulBird7776* and so on. `usergen` offers a cheap, simple and fast way to create large numbers of user names, for example for testing or staging environments.

Without any command line arguments, `usergen` generates a single user name and prints it to `stdout`:
```
>usergen
GreenWeekend7438
```
