# usergen - user name generator
Small program to generate usernames, such as _AmbitiousParrot2012_, _LonelyPossibility87965_ and _HopefulBird7776_. 

`usergen` offers a cheap, simple and fast way to create large numbers of user names, for example for testing or staging environments. No
need to burn through your GPT tokens to generate user names ðŸ˜Š.

Without any command line arguments, `usergen` generates a single user name and prints it to `stdout`:
```
$>./usergen
GreenWeekend7438
$>
```
## Pattern
You can provide a pattern to control how the user names are patched together. By default, the standard pattern is `AdjectiveNounNumber4` (see also above). By providing a pattern as command line argument, `usergen` generates different user names. For example, the pattern `the_Adjective_And___Noun`
generates user names of the following forms:
```
$>./usergen the_Adjective_And___Noun -c 5
the_Punctual_And___Bug
the_Comical_And___Dinner
the_Defiant_And___Yard
the_Mawkish_And___Kitchen
the_Quirky_And___Button
$>
```
The `-c 5` parameter tells the program to generate five user names. The following elements are recognized to build patterns:
- `Adjective`: upper case adjective
- `adjective`: lower case adjective
- `Noun`: upper case Noun
- `noun`: lower case Noun
- `Number`: random number, followed by a single digit to denote the number of digits of the random number
## Options
The following additional options can be used to control the output of `usergen`.
- `-c`, `--count`: number of user names to generate
- `-s`, `--seed`: srand initializer seed number. If not provided, a time-based initialization will be used.
## How to compile
Since `usergen` is a single source file, compiling is trivial:
```
clang usergen.c -o usergen
```
I use `clang` in this case, but any other C compiler should do as well.

## License
Do whatever you want with it. I stole parts of it and you can steal mine too.
